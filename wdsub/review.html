      <p>This pen is peak middle school, I have never had a better middle school experience with this pen, even now I will sometimes use this pen. While the consistancy and quality control may not be the best, this pen is peak, especcially for the price, worth every penny.</p>

  <p>Pilot G2's are basically the equivalent to a BIC Round Stic M, but for adult life, nomatter what you are doing, this pen is the easiest, most conveinent, and while quite costly, it's worth it, the only bad part is that when I'm not in public, I write with my left hand and these tend to smear. Otherwise these are awesome.</p>

      <p>I DONT KNOW WHERE THEY COME FROM!!! But they are so so soooooo good.... I love these pens so much, and if you don't support the brand, you can always just scratch it off or even just sharpie it out. It's cheep, and they are consistant, and it is awesome to use. </p>

      <p>These are absolute DOGWATER. While fairly cheep, for the same amount of money you could have bought a BIC Round Stic M, but the feelig as the led goes acrross the paper kills me a little bit every time, it feels terrible and I Hate It. Every time I pick up this pen, I suddently wish I brought my own pen because these just suck. The consistancy dwendles over time because it WILL get harder to write with because it WILL get smaller. Your eraser will break, and you will be one sad, sad boy.</p>
